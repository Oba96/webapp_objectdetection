# webapp_objectdetection
Web application with tensorflow serving and flask

We were tasked by a company to design an enterprise machine learning system which is  capable of undertaking object detection tasks. We implemented our solution using Flask for our frontend application and allow it to communicate with TensorFlow serving hosted in Docker using an appropriate communications protocol(gRPC API). The inferencing elements of the system should be run on the GPU to provide appropriate inferencing speed.
